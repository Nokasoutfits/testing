            SwizzFunds now offers all traders the opportunity to
            trade a wide range of the top ranked digital coins 24/7*. Today
            cryptocurrencies have become known to most people as a conventional
            and popular investment option. The main purpose of this new
            technology is to allow people to buy, trade, and invest without the
            need for banks or any other financial institution. Cryptocurrencies
            are highly volatile and can be profitable to any traderâ€™s portfolio.
            Cryptocurrencies are not physical coins they are electronic, a
            digital asset that remains as data. The technology behind the
            cryptocurrency controls a large part of its value which holds new
            technology on the secure way to identify and transfer money. The
            first digital coin introduced was the Bitcoin and today it remains
            as the standard that all other coins compare themselves to.
            Following in its steps came Litecoin, so to date they stand as the
            top 2 highly valued coins on the market. There are several other
            coins also reaching a high-level market share such as Bitcoin and
            Bitcoin Cash, Dash, Ripple, Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.
